There is no "right" answer. There are many good ways to do and go about this.
What we want to dive into is why you did things the way that you did, and whether or not you would change that looking back.

Finding Patterns Review questions:

- How did you identify the user personas you came up with?
- How did you choose a name you felt would catch the attention of your primary user personas?

Work Breakdown Review questions:

- How did you choose which features should be part of the MVP?
- How did your MVP and user personas guide the creation of your user stories?

Bring Your Idea to Life Review Questions:

- Did the user stories help when you were designing your wireframes? How?
- Why did you design the homepage the way you did?
- Was there some element of the user personas, MVP, or user stories that helped you choose a homepage design?
- Why did you pick the photo you did? Can you think of a better photo?

Extra Credit:

- Why did you pick the companies that you did?
- What did you learn about the company's design as you researched them? What did you like? What did you not like?
- Why did the company choose the stack it did?
