		<h1>About My neighborhood</h1>

		<p>
			It's pretty nice I guess. There's a kid who is constantly riding his toy motorcycle around the block. Like around and around and around. Sometimes I'm like "damn how does this kid have so much time to ride his electric motorcycle around the block over and over?" But usually I'm just a little jealous because I always wanted a little electric motorcycle as a kid. I'm happy for him.

		<p>There's also a nice little park just down the street from me called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yRzmccVLa4QhgkKK9" target="_blank">Broadmoor Park</a>.</p>
