How does the internet work? 
 - The internet is a collection of networks and servers that communicate with each other through requests and responses. Clients (browsers) send requests to servers by accessing their unique IP address. Servers receive those requests and perform logic to return the correct information to the client. 

 What happens when you click on a link?
  - Your browser sends a request to the URL contained in the link. That URL contains a protocol, hostname (which is connected to an IP address), and resource/endpoint. Depending on the response from the server at the URL, you will most likely be redirected to another page where it will load the resource specified in the URL.
